Five Configurations differ between development and production environments

I would say some things that could be different between development and production environments
would include, size of scale of production (probably bigger in production than development), 
production will have real data (actual books?), production will have services spread across more services I'm guessing a database will come in to play at some point and that probably won't be
on the same server as web, more emphasis on security in production, and capacity will be more robust in production versus development
